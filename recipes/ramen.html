    <h1>Ramen</h1>
       <img src="/Users/francismaliwat/repos/odin-recipes/images/ramen.jpeg" alt="Bowl of Ramen">
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Controversial opinion alert, but there is a time and a place for a big warm pot o’ ramen noodles, complete with – I’m going to say it – the ramen seasoning packet. For me, that would be circa 2007 sitting on the floor of a small dorm room with millions of Christmas lights hanging up for no reason whatsoever, or on the couch at home during a rainy sick day home from work when that extra-salty broth hits just right.</p>

        <h2>Ingreddients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
                <li>3 teaspoons grated ginger</li>
                <li>4 teaspoons grated garlic</li>
                <li>4 cups broth (I used chicken, but vegetable would also work)</li>
                <li>4 cups water</li>
                <li>1 ounce dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
                <li>2 packages instant ramen (noodles only!)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup chopped scallions or chives</li>
                <li>2 cup chopped kale</li>
                <li>1 cups shredded carrots</li>
                <li>1 cups shredded carrots</li>
                <li>Sriracha to taste</li>
                <li>crunchy golden panko crumbs for topping (see FAQs)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over medium low heat. Add the garlic and ginger; stir fry for 2 minutes or until soft and fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Add the broth and the water. Bring to a simmer; add the mushrooms and simmer for 10 minutes or until the mushrooms have softened and the broth is flavorful.</li>
                    <li>Add the instant noodles to the hot liquid and simmer for an additional 5 minutes or until the noodles have softened. Add the scallions and stir to combine.</li>
                    <li>Remove from heat, stir in the kale and carrots, and top with crunchy panko crumbs (see notes) and a soft-boiled egg (optional). Season with chili oil, hot sauce, sesame oil, and/or soy sauce and salt to taste.</li>
                </ol>
